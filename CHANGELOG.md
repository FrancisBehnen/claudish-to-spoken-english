## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `claude-cli` provider: rewrites can run through the local `claude` binary in
  print mode, on your existing Claude Code subscription instead of a metered API
  key or a local model (~8–12 s per message on an M3, versus ~15–25 s for a
  local model that fits 16 GB). The message travels on stdin so long messages
  are not capped by `ARG_MAX`; recursion is guarded with `CLAUDISH_ENABLED=0` in
  the child's environment; no MCP servers are loaded; and the session is not
  persisted. New vars: `CLAUDISH_CLAUDE_BIN`, `CLAUDISH_CLAUDE_DISALLOW`
  (FrancisBehnen/claudish-to-spoken-english#12).
- `_llm_run_bounded`: a watchdog that TERMs then KILLs a child at
  `LLM_TIMEOUT` seconds. The HTTP providers get their bound from
  `curl --max-time`, but macOS ships no `timeout(1)`, so a subprocess provider
  has to bring its own — without it a wedged CLI could stall the assistant's
  answer and break the fail-open contract.
- `ratelimited` is now part of the `llm_complete` contract, so a subscription
  quota refusal gets its own once-per-session notice rather than a generic one.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- Customizable rewrite prompts. Point the display hook at a prompt file with
  `CLAUDISH_PROMPT_FILE`, or the Markdown hook with `CLAUDISH_MD_PROMPT_FILE`;
  the file's contents replace the built-in prompt wholesale. An unset, empty, or
  unreadable file falls back to the built-in default, so a bad path never stops
  rewrites. Defaults are unchanged.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- Provider layer (`providers.sh`): rewrites can run against local **ollama**
  (default, unchanged), the **Anthropic** Messages API, or any
  **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint, selected with `CLAUDISH_PROVIDER` (#10).
- Runtime kill-switch flag file (`~/.claude/claudish-off`, overridable with
  `CLAUDISH_OFF_FILE`) to pause and resume rewrites mid-session, since env vars
  are frozen at launch (#4).
- Windows setup documentation and model-default guidance (#7).
- Comparison screenshot at the top of the README.

### Fixed
- Markdown `overwrite` mode: the idempotency marker is written after any YAML
  frontmatter, so the frontmatter stays on line 1 where parsers expect it.
  Leftover display-hook temp files are also cleaned up (#1).
- Quote `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in the hook commands so plugin paths containing
  spaces resolve correctly (#6).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- One-time, per-session notice explaining why a rewrite was skipped when the
  provider is unreachable, the call times out, or the model isn't available
  (`CLAUDISH_NOTICE`, default on).

### Changed
- Default model set to `gemma4:26b-mlx` (Apple-silicon MLX build).
- Separate per-hook timeouts: `CLAUDISH_TIMEOUT` (display) and
  `CLAUDISH_MD_TIMEOUT` (Markdown file).
- Added the "Configuring the plugin" section to the README.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Initial release. A `MessageDisplay` hook (`rewrite.sh`) that rewrites each
  assistant message into plain English with a local ollama model — `append`
  and `replace` display modes, a prose-length gate, and a fail-open contract
  that always leaves Claude's original text on screen if anything goes wrong.
- Optional `PostToolUse` Markdown-file rewrite hook (`rewrite-md.sh`), opt-in by
  directory (`CLAUDISH_MD_DIR`), with `sibling` and `overwrite` modes.
